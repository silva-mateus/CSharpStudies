# While Loop - CalculateSumOfNumbersBetween

## Description
Using a `while` loop, implement the `CalculateSumOfNumbersBetween` method that calculates the sum of all numbers between `firstNumber` and `lastNumber` (inclusive).

## Requirements
- If `lastNumber` < `firstNumber`, return `0`
- Include both boundary numbers in the sum

## Examples
- `CalculateSumOfNumbersBetween(5, 10)` → `45` (5+6+7+8+9+10)
- `CalculateSumOfNumbersBetween(-5, 5)` → `0` (-5+-4+-3+-2+-1+0+1+2+3+4+5)
- `CalculateSumOfNumbersBetween(10, 10)` → `10`
- `CalculateSumOfNumbersBetween(5, 4)` → `0`

## Topics Covered
- While loops
- Loop conditions
- Accumulator pattern
