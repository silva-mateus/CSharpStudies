# Do-While Loop - RepeatCharacter

## Description
Using a `do...while` loop, implement the `RepeatCharacter` method that builds a string by repeating a character a given number of times.

## Requirements
- The result must contain **at least one character** (even if `targetLength` is 0 or negative)

## Examples
- `RepeatCharacter('a', 4)` → `"aaaa"`
- `RepeatCharacter('!', 0)` → `"!"`
- `RepeatCharacter('b', 1)` → `"b"`
- `RepeatCharacter('c', -1)` → `"c"`

## Topics Covered
- Do-while loops
- String building
- Loop guarantees (executes at least once)
