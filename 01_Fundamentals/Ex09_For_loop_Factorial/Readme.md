# For Loop - Factorial

## Description
Using a `for` loop, implement the `Factorial` method that calculates the factorial of a given number.

## Explanation
Factorial of N is the product of all integers from 1 to N:
```
N! = 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × (N-1) × N
```

## Examples
- `5! = 1×2×3×4×5 = 120`
- `4! = 1×2×3×4 = 24`
- `1! = 1`
- `0! = 1` (by convention)

## Assumptions
- Input number is non-negative

## Topics Covered
- For loops
- Factorial calculation
- Accumulator pattern
