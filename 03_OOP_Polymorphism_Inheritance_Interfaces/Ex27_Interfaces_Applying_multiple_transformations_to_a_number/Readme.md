Interfaces - Applying multiple transformations to a number
Implement all types necessary to make this code work:



You will need to define the INumericTransformation interface and the following classes implementing it:

By1Incrementer, whose Transform method adds 1 to the input

By2Multiplier, whose Transform method multiplies input by 2

ToPowerOf2Raiser, whose Transform method raises input to the power of 2

All those transformations will be applied to the given number, so for example, if the input is 4, the result of the Exercise.Transform method will be 100 because:

4 will be incremented by 1, giving 5

5 will be multiplied by 2, giving 10

10 will be raised to the power of 2, giving 100
