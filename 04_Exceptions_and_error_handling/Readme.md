# Try-catch-finally. DivideNumbers
In the exercise, you will find the DivideNumbers method, which for now, simply divides two integers. Currently, this method throws an exception when the b argument is zero.

Modify this method in such a way that:

- When the b argument is zero, the result returned from this method is zero. Also, "Division by zero." is printed to the console.
- No matter if b is zero or not, after the calculation has been performed, this method should also print "The DivideNumbers method ends."

This means when dividing by zero, the following will be printed:

"Division by zero.
The DivideNumbers method ends."

And when devising by another number than zero, only the following will be printed:

"The DivideNumbers method ends."
