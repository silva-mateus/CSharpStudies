# OrderBy, First & Last
Implement the FindShortestWord method, which finds the shortest words in a collection of strings. If more than one word has the same minimal length, the first one on order should be returned.

For example:

- For words {"aaa", "b", "c", "dd"}, the result shall be "b" because it is the shortest (only 1 letter) and is before another word with the same length ("c")

- For an empty collection, an exception should be thrown
