You can find the **Pwd** class in the **15\_PasswordGenerator** project in the solution attached to the course. 

The simplest way to approach this is to follow those steps:

* Understand what the existing code does and how it works. To do that, it may be useful to run the code a couple of times with different arguments and see the results. You can also place some breakpoints to track the execution step-by-step.  
* \[Optional\] Refactor the code to be unit-testable (so mocking the Random class can be done). Remember to follow the Dependency Inversion Principle and use Dependency Injection  
* \[Optional\] Add unit tests  
* Perform the main refactoring  
    
  If you didn’t add unit tests, make sure to test the code manually, to check if it still works as before.
