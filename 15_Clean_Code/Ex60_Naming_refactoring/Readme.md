# Naming refactoring - Building file path based on DateTime
Create a refactored version of the BuildFilePathFrom method so its code is clear and it uses good naming.

Do not modify the BuildFilePathFrom method itself - treat it as a reference.

Implement only the BuildFilePathFrom _Refactored method.

Both methods should work exactly the same.
