# Method refactoring - ChooseBetterPath method
Create a refactored version of the ChooseBetterPath method so its code is clear, and it uses good naming.

Do not modify the ChooseBetterPath method itself - treat it as a reference.

Implement only the ChooseBetterPath _Refactored method.

Both methods should work exactly the same.
