Method refactoring - IsNameValid method
Create a refactored version of the IsValidName method so its code is clear and of high quality



Do not modify the IsValidName method itself - treat it as a reference.

Implement only the IsValidName _Refactored method.



Both methods should work exactly the same.



In case you wonder, the return type (bool, string) is a value tuple. We learned about them in the Advanced C# types section.
