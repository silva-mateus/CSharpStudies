# Creating and starting new threads
Implement the RunThreads method in such a way that it creates and starts three new threads. Each thread job is to print "Hello from thread with ID: X" to the console, where X is the thread's ID.



For example, after the execution of the RunThreads method, output like this should be printed (of course, it may have different thread IDs):

Hello from thread with ID: 13
Hello from thread with ID: 14
Hello from thread with ID: 15


Make sure to print this exact message with those words and characters.
