# Async/await
The Test method given in the exercise uses the DownloadDataAsync method, which currently does not exist.

Implement this method in such a way that the code compiles without issues. This method should:

1) Be asynchronous
2) Wait for 1 second
3) Print to the console "Content from URL 'FIRST_PARAM' is 'SECOND_PARAM'", where FIRST_PARAM and SECOND_PARAM should be replaced with values of the method parameters.
