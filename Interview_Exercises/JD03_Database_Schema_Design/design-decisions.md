# Design Decisions

<!-- TODO: Document your schema design decisions below. -->

## Data Type Choices

<!-- Why did you choose specific data types? E.g., DECIMAL(18,2) vs MONEY for fines, NVARCHAR lengths, etc. -->

## Normalization

<!-- What normalization level did you achieve? Any intentional denormalization? Why? -->

## Index Strategy

<!-- Which indexes did you create and why? What query patterns do they support? -->

## Relationship Design

<!-- How did you model many-to-many relationships (Books-Authors, Books-Categories)? -->

## Constraints

<!-- What CHECK constraints, DEFAULT values, and ON DELETE behaviors did you choose and why? -->

## Trade-offs

<!-- Any trade-offs you considered? Performance vs. normalization? Simplicity vs. flexibility? -->
